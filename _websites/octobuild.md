Every year, I administer and run a month-long online hackathon of sorts in October. It is small in scope, so far, but always fun to see what people make. This year, I overhauled the website, changing most of the copy and how we're running things. I plan to make Octobuild a bit wider in scope this year, and see if we can get more participants, prizes, and judges.
