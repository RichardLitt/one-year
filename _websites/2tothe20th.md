2^20th is an idea I had for how to gamify making money. Making a million dollars sounds really hard; but making two dollars doesn't. If you can make two, then you can probably make four; the same for eight. The human mind doesn't do exponential math so well, so you can pretend that the next step is easier. Another good part of thinking of making money this way is that, if the next step seems to hard, you can always break it down - you've already made half of that. Just do what you've already done, but again.

This website is based off this idea. I need to work on my marketing strategy, however; I thought it might work as a minimal site, but I think it is too minimal, and comes off as brash. So, I am going to probably overhaul it at some point soon.
